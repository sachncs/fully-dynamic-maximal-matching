"""Simulation and replay utilities for dynamic update sequences.

These helpers are engineering utilities, not part of the paper's baseline
algorithm.  They allow reproducible experiments and stress tests by
producing fixed ``(insert | delete, u, v)`` traces that can be replayed
against any :class:`DynamicMaximalMatching` instance.

Determinism:
    * All randomness is drawn from the caller-supplied :class:`random.Random`
      so two runs with the same seed produce identical sequences.
    * Yields operations in a single canonical edge order
      ``(min, max)`` so duplicate ``(u, v)`` and ``(v, u)`` are folded
      into the same logical edge.

Limitations:
    * The generator only produces edges that were previously absent or
      present, so the edge set at the end of a length-``steps`` run
      tends to fluctuate around a stationary density.  It cannot be
      used to construct "the worst case" of the algorithm directly.
