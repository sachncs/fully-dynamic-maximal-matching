"""Explicit counters for update work and phase-level accounting.

The paper's amortised-time analysis is not directly executable in Python:
the constants in the analysis depend on the hidden costs of the BST
adjacency lists, the ABB+26 colouring routine, and the Vizing flip.
This module implements **explicit counters** that record the work
actually performed by the Python reproduction -- number of updates,
rebuilds, and the size of every per-vertex scan.  Experiments can use
these counters to diagnose where time is spent without claiming any
asymptotic bound.

Empirical interpretation:
    * ``total_updates`` ≈ total number of insert + delete calls
      accepted by the algorithm (the paper calls this the "update
      count").
    * ``phase_rebuilds`` should grow roughly linearly with
      ``total_updates / phase_length``; a deviation indicates a bug.
    * The three ``rematch_*_scans`` fields are the empirical analogues
      of the amortised scan costs in the paper's analysis.  They sum
      to ``phase_update_work`` so the average scan length can be
      compared against the theoretical bounds.

    """Counters for auditing the cost of dynamic updates.

    Every counter starts at zero and increments monotonically.  The
    counters are intentionally simple int fields so they can be exposed
    cheaply through :meth:`snapshot`.

    Attributes:
        total_updates: Total accepted insert + delete operations.
        total_insertions: Insertions only.
        total_deletions: Deletions only (including no-op deletes of
            non-existent edges, which are still recorded as a deletion).
        phase_rebuilds: Number of full :math:`z`-system rebuilds.
        subphase_rebuilds: Number of :math:`M_1` augmentations at
            subphase boundaries.
        rematch_u_scans: Cumulative vertex count scanned during
            :func:`fdmm.updates.rematch_u`.
        rematch_b_scans: Same, for :func:`fdmm.updates.rematch_b`.
        rematch_a_scans: Same, for :func:`fdmm.updates.rematch_a`.
        greedy_rebuilds: Times the full greedy reconstruction of
            :math:`M^*` was used as a fallback.
        stale_cleanups: Total edges removed from :math:`M^*` because
            they had been deleted from the graph.
        phase_update_work: A running tally of per-phase work units,
            reset by :meth:`record_phase_rebuild`.  Excluded from the
            default ``repr`` because it is mostly internal state.
