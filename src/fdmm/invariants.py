"""Invariant checkers for the :math:`z`-subgraph system and maximal matching.

These functions provide standalone validation that can be called from tests
or debugging scripts.  They do not modify state; they are read-only
diagnostics intended to make regressions visible immediately during
development.

Mathematical background:
    The :math:`z`-subgraph system carries six invariants whose conjunction
    guarantees the :math:`\tilde O(n^{2/3})` per-update cost of the
    basic algorithm (Section 2 of the paper).  They are validated
    individually by the methods of :class:`ZSubgraphSystem` and bundled
    here so that external code (tests, benchmarks) can call a single
    entry point.

    Invariant (I3) for the multi-level system requires a precise
    constant that the paper excerpt omits; we therefore refuse to give
    a definitive answer rather than risk silently accepting a false
    positive.
