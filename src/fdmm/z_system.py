r"""The :math:`z`-subgraph system and multi-level generalisation.

This module defines the combinatorial data structures that lie at the heart
of the paper's algorithm.  The implementation follows the notation and
invariants of Section 2 as closely as possible.

Mathematical background:
    A :math:`z`-subgraph system is a triple :math:`(A, B, U)` partitioning
    the vertex set together with an edge set :math:`M` that satisfies:

    * every :math:`v \in S := A \cup B` has :math:`\deg_M(v) = z`,
    * every :math:`u \in U` has :math:`\deg_M(u) \le z`,
    * :math:`|N_G(u) \cap U| \le z` for :math:`u \in U` (a degree cap
      inside :math:`U` that prevents runaway promotion chains),
    * (P1) :math:`|N_G(u) \cap B| \le 2z` for every :math:`u \in U`,
    * (P2) every :math:`M`-edge incident to :math:`a \in A` meets a vertex
      of :math:`S`.

    Each :math:`u \in U` is maintained alongside two index lists:
    :math:`\Lambda(u) = N_G(u) \cap (B \cup U)` and
    :math:`L(a) = N_G(a) \cap U`.  These lists drive the amortised
    :math:`\tilde O(n^{2/3})` per-update bound of the basic algorithm.

    A multi-level system stacks :math:`k` such systems at decreasing
    values of :math:`z`, allowing the recursion to yield the improved
    :math:`n^{1/2+o(1)}` bound in the full version.

    Dynamic Maximal Matching" (arXiv:2605.00797v1), Sections 2 and 5.

Assumptions:
    * Vertex labels are dense integers ``0 .. n-1`` (a property inherited
      from :class:`fdmm.graph.DynamicGraph`).
    * The system is freshly constructed via :func:`build_z_system`; it is
      the caller's responsibility to maintain :math:`\Lambda` and
      :math:`L` thereafter (or to invoke :meth:`build_lambda_and_L`).

Limitations:
    * The exact edge-switching rule of the paper's Step 2 construction
      is replaced with a BFS-based augmenting-path heuristic.  See the
      notes on :func:`edge_switch_inside_B`.

class ZSubgraphSystem:
    r"""A single-level :math:`z`-subgraph system.

    Attributes:
        graph: The underlying dynamic graph.
        z: Degree parameter.
        A: Vertices in set :math:`A`.
        B: Vertices in set :math:`B`.

        L_lists: For each :math:`a \in A`, the list
            :math:`L(a) = N_G(a) \cap U`.

    Lifecycle:
        A system is normally built by :func:`build_z_system`.  After any
        mutation of ``self.graph`` the cached lists in ``lambda_lists``
        and ``L_lists`` must be refreshed via
        :meth:`build_lambda_and_L`.  Mutating ``A``, ``B``, ``U``, or
        ``M`` directly is permitted (this is what the dynamic update
        code does) but should be followed by
        :meth:`check_all_invariants` to verify the system stays legal.

    Thread-safety:
        Not thread-safe.  A ``ZSubgraphSystem`` should be touched only
        from the thread that owns the underlying ``DynamicGraph``.

def build_z_system(graph: DynamicGraph, z: int) -> ZSubgraphSystem:
    r"""Build a :math:`z`-subgraph system from scratch.

    Implements the two-step deterministic construction from Section 5.2
    of the paper.

    Step 1 -- greedy maximal :math:`M` with the degree cap ``z``::

        For each edge (u, v) in sorted order:
            if deg_M(u) < z and deg_M(v) < z:
                add (u, v) to M; increment both degrees.

    The initial partition is then derived from :math:`M`:

    * :math:`v \in S := A \cup B` iff :math:`\deg_M(v) = z`,
    * :math:`v \in A` iff :math:`v \in S` and every :math:`M`-neighbour of
      ``v`` is also in :math:`S`,
    * :math:`v \in B` iff :math:`v \in S` and some :math:`M`-neighbour of
      ``v`` lies in :math:`U`,
    * :math:`v \in U` iff :math:`\deg_M(v) < z`.

    Step 2 -- promote U-vertices to B until no further promotion is
    possible.  Promotion is handled by :func:`promote_u_vertex` which
    tries direct edges first and falls back to edge-switching inside B.

    **Fidelity note:** Step 2 uses an alternating-path edge-switching
    heuristic that approximates the paper's exact switching rule.  The
    paper states that edge-switching inside B preserves degree bounds;
    our implementation achieves this via BFS-based augmenting paths.

    Args:
        graph: The host graph.
        z: The degree parameter (``z >= 1``).

    Returns:
        A :class:`ZSubgraphSystem` satisfying every invariant checked
        by :meth:`ZSubgraphSystem.check_all_invariants`.

    Complexity:
        :math:`O(n + m)` per promotion round; the number of rounds is
        bounded by a polynomial in ``n`` so the overall construction is
        polynomial.  Empirically the loop converges in a handful of
        rounds on sparse inputs.
