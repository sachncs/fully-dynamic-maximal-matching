r"""Deterministic edge-coloring routines.

**Fidelity note:** The paper invokes Theorem 2.4 (ABB+26) for deterministic
:math:`(\Delta+1)`-edge-coloring in :math:`O(m^{1+o(1)})` time.  The full
ABB+26 algorithm is not provided in the paper excerpt.  This module provides
two implementations:

1. ``abb_edge_color`` -- a fast greedy colouring with conflict resolution
   that runs in :math:`O(m \cdot \Delta)` worst case but is significantly
   faster in practice than the classical Vizing alternating-path approach.
   Uses degree-ordered processing and colour-class maintenance for efficiency.

2. ``vizing_edge_color`` -- the original Vizing alternating-path recolouring
   with backtracking fallback.  Correct and uses at most :math:`\Delta+1`
   colours but slower.

Both algorithms produce valid (Δ+1)-edge-colourings.  The ABB approximation
is preferred for performance while maintaining correctness.

Mathematical background:
    Vizing's theorem (Vizing 1964) states that every simple graph admits a
    proper edge-coloring with at most :math:`\Delta + 1` colours, where
    :math:`\Delta` is the maximum degree.  The constructive proof is by
    induction on the number of edges: assuming a partial colouring on
    :math:`E \setminus \{e\}`, the unfavourable case is that every colour
    is used at one endpoint of ``e``; flipping a two-colour alternating
    path frees one colour at the other endpoint.  The paper cites a more
    recent deterministic construction (Theorem 2.4, ABB+26) running in
    :math:`O(m^{1+o(1)})` time; we approximate that result with a degree-
    ordered greedy scheme.

Limitations:
    * The :math:`O(m^{1+o(1)})` bound of Theorem 2.4 is **not** met here.
      ``abb_edge_color`` is :math:`O(m \cdot \Delta)` worst case and
      ``vizing_edge_color`` is :math:`O(m \cdot \Delta)` plus an
      exponential backtracking fallback for stubborn instances.

    in the paper excerpt), this achieves good practical performance.

    Algorithm (pseudocode):
        1. Build ``vertex_colors[v] = {c : (v, ?) has color c}``.
        2. Process edges in decreasing ``deg(u) + deg(v)`` order so that

        3. For each edge ``(u, v)`` find the smallest ``c`` not used at
           either endpoint; assign it.
        4. If no such ``c`` exists, call
           :func:`recolour_for_edge` to attempt a short alternating-path
