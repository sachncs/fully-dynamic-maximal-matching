r"""Dynamic undirected graph with adjacency sets.

**Fidelity note:** The paper states that adjacency lists are stored as binary
search trees to support :math:`O(\log n)` insertion, deletion, and lookup.
In this Python reproduction we use the built-in ``set`` type, which provides
amortised :math:`O(1)` operations.  The asymptotic guarantees of the
algorithm are preserved; only the hidden constant factors differ.

Responsibilities:
    * Maintain the live edge set under online insertions and deletions.
    * Provide neighbour and edge iterators that yield every edge exactly
      once in canonical form.
    * Validate vertex labels and reject invalid inputs early.

Interactions:
    * Used as the storage layer by the dynamic matcher in
      :mod:`fdmm.dynamic_matching`.
    * The greedy matching helpers in :mod:`fdmm.matching` read only.
    * The :mod:`fdmm.z_system` module reads adjacency when reconstructing
      :math:`\Lambda` and :math:`L` lists.

Thread-safety:
    * Instances are **not** thread-safe.  Each ``DynamicMaximalMatching``
      owns one ``DynamicGraph`` and is intended to be used from a single
      thread.  Concurrent access would require external locking.

    Vertices are dense integer labels ``0 .. n-1`` fixed at construction.

    endpoints, but iteration yields the canonical form ``(u, v)`` with
    ``u < v`` so callers see every edge exactly once.
