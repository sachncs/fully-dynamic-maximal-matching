"""Matching helpers and maximality checks.

These are generic graph-algorithm utilities used by the dynamic-matching
engine.  They are not specific to the paper's subgraph-system framework;
they exist so that the rest of the codebase can rely on a small, well-
documented API for "give me a maximal matching of this graph" and
"is this matching maximal?".

Responsibilities:
    * Produce a maximal matching from scratch via a deterministic greedy
      scan (used as a baseline and as a fallback when repair fails).
    * Verify maximality in :math:`O(n + m)` by checking every vertex.
    * Provide :math:`O(|M|)` partner lookups and :math:`O(1)` partner
      maps used by the dynamic update code in :mod:`fdmm.updates`.

Assumptions:
    * The graph may be empty; every helper tolerates ``n == 0``.
    * The matching may be empty; maximality of the empty set on the
      empty graph is ``True`` by convention.

    """Return a maximal matching computed by a deterministic greedy scan.

    Vertices are processed in increasing order and the first available
    neighbour is chosen.  This guarantees determinism for a fixed graph
    regardless of the underlying set iteration order, since the loop
    always uses the same access pattern.  The construction is used as a
    baseline for the paper's incremental rebuild of ``M*`` and as a
    safe fallback whenever dynamic repair cannot recover maximality.

        graph: The graph to match against.

    Returns:
        A maximal matching as a set of canonical edges.

    Complexity:
